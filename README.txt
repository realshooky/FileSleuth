Readme File for "FileSleuth" a File Signature Detection Program by Tyler Shook
---------------------------------------------------------------
This program is designed to be used from a command line interface on
any system. It is designed to take a file of user's choice, detect
the file signature, and output to stdout the correct file extension/type.

This is a project to further test and hone my abilities as a programmer.
It will be published to my personal GitHub Repository and remain open source
to receive feedback and improvements to my personal style and abilities.

Syntax for calling program: $./FileSleuth.exe <pathToFile>

There should be only one parameter passed to the program. Any more or less
will cause a premature termination of the program and an error message to
print to stdout.

Current File Formats Implemented:
JPEG
PNG
BMP
PDF

File Signatures gathered from www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html
